## blockr.ui for users

We strived to make it as simple as possible, yet with a totally flexible layout. All panels can be resized and rearranged to your liking.

### The user interface

![](./figures/blockr-ui.png)

That's how `blockr.ui` looks like.

(1) The top navigation bar contains buttons to import or export any existing work you did before.
(2) The left pipeline panel has a __toolbar__ which exposes quick actions such as:

    - adding a new block.
    - Removing a set of selected blocks.
    - Saving the current work.
    - Restore a previous state.
    - Zoom in or out on the network.
    - ...

(3) In the center of the panel is displayed the current blockr pipeline where __blocks__ are represented as __nodes__ and connections as __edges__. In our example, we have 1 invalid __block__ which __state__ is depicted as orange. The reason is explained in the bottom right corner of the UI where __error__ messages are displayed (in this specific case, the block is missing input data). Blocks can be grouped together within __stacks__, as shown with the grey circle. This is convenient as stacks can be collapsed or expanded, thereby saving significant amount of space in the UI. You can also drag and drop nodes in or out of a stack to add/remove them, respectively. Pretty much all elements on the canvas have a right click action, also known as a __context menu__. For example, right-clicking on a node will show you options to remove it, add another node right after, connect it to another node or add/remove it in the right side dashboard. Right clicking on the canvas will show you options to add a new block or add a new stack. These actions can be customised as explained in the following [vignette](app-modules.html).

(4) The bottom right corner hosts the __properties__ panels. It displays the properties of the any existing block. They can be closed but reappear if you click on the corresponding node in the graph. You can edit these properties directly in the UI, like changing the currently selected data. In future releases, you will be able to change the block name and more.

(5) You may control __global options__ from the top right corner. This opens a menu where some options can be changed, such as the current theme, the dashboard zoom, ...

(6) The right side __dashboard__ is a place to add blocks outputs such as plots, tables or any other output that can be produced by a block. You can add blocks to the dashboard by right-clicking on them and selecting "Add to dashboard" and remove them by right-clicking on the dashboard output and selecting "Remove from dashboard". The dashboard can be resized and each panel can be dragged to rearrange the layout.

(7) The bottom left corner displays the current pipeline __error logs__.

## blockr.ui for developers

If you are a developer and want to get a better undestanding of how `blockr.ui` works, this section is for you. We'll explain how to run an app and how to customize it.

### Run an application

To start an app with `blockr.ui`, you can use:

```r
library(blockr.dplyr)
library(blockr.sdtm)
library(blockr.ai)
library(blockr.io)
library(blockr.ui)

# To customize
Sys.setenv(
  "SNAPSHOT_LOCATION" = "<PATH_TO_SNAPSHOT_LOCATION>",
  "AUTO_SNAPSHOT" = FALSE
)
run_demo_app()
```

This code can be deployed on any server that supports R and Shiny, such as Shiny Server or RStudio Connect. You may notice
that we load each blockr related package to make blocks available to the end user in the app.

You can also spin up a custom app with existing blocks, links and stacks, like so:

```r
library(blockr.ui)

run_demo_app(
  blocks = c(
    a = new_dataset_block("BOD"),
    b = new_dataset_block("ChickWeight"),
    c = new_merge_block("Time")
  ),
  links = c(
    ac = new_link("a", "c", "x"),
    bc = new_link("b", "c", "y")
  ),
  stacks = list(ac = c("a", "c"))
)
```

This feature is convenient to setup demonstrations apps quickly.

### Customizing the app

`blockr.ui` can be customized in various ways. In the following we detail the most common ones.

#### Anatomy of blockr.ui

`blockr.ui` is built on top of `blockr.core` and uses its functionalities to create a Shiny app. At the root, we have a __board__ object which is a collection of blocks, links and stacks. The board is created using `blockr.core::new_board()`.

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: default
flowchart TD
  subgraph board[Board]
    subgraph stack1[Stack 1]
      direction TB
      blk_1[Block 1]
      blk_2[Block 2]
      blk_1 --> |link| blk_2
    end
  end
```

In `blockr.ui`, we designed a custom board, namely a `dag_board` object via `new_dag_board()`.

This allows us to create a custom UI with `board_ui.dag_board` with a totally different flavor as in the `blockr.core` version. Below is a summary of the UI components:

```r
tagList(
  off_canvas(
    id = paste0(id, "-offcanvas"),
    title = "Board",
    blocks
  ),
  board_header(id, my_board_ui),
  dockViewOutput(
    paste0(id, "-layout"),
    width = "100%",
    height = "100vh"
  ),
  scoutbar(
    sprintf("%s-scoutbar", id),
    placeholder = "What do you want to do?",
    showRecentSearch = TRUE
  )
)
```

On the server side, we have a `board_server.dag_board` function which handles the server logic for the board:

```r
board_server(
  "board",
  board,
  plugins = plugins,
  callbacks = c(
    lapply(modules, board_module_server),
    list(
      # Callback to signal other modules that the restore is done.
      # This allows to restore each part in the correct order.
      on_board_restore = board_restore,
      manage_scoutbar = manage_scoutbar,
      layout = build_layout(modules, plugins)
    )
  ),
  parent = app_state
)
```

This function works on the board object as well as other elements. `callbacks` are functions or Shiny modules that are injected in the same namespace as the board server. Unlike callbacks, plugins are submodules of the board, so the namespace is prefixed by the board namespace. __Plugins__ and __modules__ are detailed below. Finally, the `parent` argument is used to pass the app __state__ object which is used to store the current state of the app and communicate between modules and plugins. We have a specific state method for the `dag_board` class (see `create_app_state()`) but you could design your own state object, which would however require to also modify plugins and modules to ensure consistency.

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: default
flowchart TD
  modules[Modules]
  board_obj[Board object]
  modules --> board_obj
  board_obj --> |serve.dag_board| app

  subgraph app[App]
    plugins[Plugins]
    plugins --> main

    subgraph main[Main module]
      app_state[App state]

      subgraph board[Board module]
        direction LR

        subgraph board_callbacks[Board callbacks]
          direction TB
          board_restore[Restore]
          manage_scoutbar[Scoutbar management]
          layout[Layout management]
        end

        subgraph board_modules[Board modules]
          subgraph dashboard_module[Dashboard module]
          end
        end
        
        subgraph board_plugins[Board plugins]
          direction LR
          manage_blocks[Manage blocks plugin]
          manage_links[Manage links plugin]
          manage_stacks[Manage stacks plugin]
          generate_code[Generate code plugin]
          notify_user[Notify user plugin]
        end

      end
      
      board_modules <-.-> |update| app_state
      board_callbacks <-.-> |update| app_state
      board_plugins <-.-> |update| app_state
      
    end
  end
```

#### Pass custom modules

Under the hoods, `run_demo_app()` serves a `dag_board` object which is created via `new_dag_board()`:

```{r}
my_board <- new_dag_board(
  blocks = c(
    a = new_dataset_block("BOD"),
    b = new_dataset_block("ChickWeight"),
    c = new_merge_block("Time")
  ),
  links = c(
    ac = new_link("a", "c", "x"),
    bc = new_link("b", "c", "y")
  ),
  stacks = list(ac = c("a", "c")),
  modules = list(
    new_dashboard_module()
  )
)

my_board
```

We use the `...` to pass blocks, links and stacks to the board. The `modules` argument is used to attach one or several __modules__ to the board. In this case, we use `new_dashboard_module()` to attach the default dashboard module. We dedicated an entire [article](app-modules.html) to explain how to create custom modules.

#### Manage plugins

As discussed in the `blockr.core` plugins [vignette](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.core/articles/extend-blockr.html#blockr-plugins), __plugins__ are Shiny modules used to customize/enhance UX aspects of the board module.

To control which plugin to use in the app, you can use the `blockr.core::plugins()`, like so:

```{r}
my_plugins <- plugins(
  preserve_board(server = ser_deser_server, ui = ser_deser_ui),
  manage_blocks(server = add_rm_block_server, ui = add_rm_block_ui),
  manage_links(
    server = gen_add_rm_link_server(ctx_menu_items),
    ui = add_rm_link_ui
  ),
  manage_stacks(server = add_rm_stack_server, ui = add_rm_stack_ui),
  generate_code(server = generate_code_server, ui = generate_code_ui),
  notify_user()
)
my_plugins
```

`blockr.ui` improves few of the core modules such as the `gen_add_rm_link_server()` and `add_rm_link_ui()` which is responsible for managing node and edges and connections with the `g6R` [package](https://cynkra.github.io/g6R/). Blocks management is done via the `add_rm_block_server()` and `add_rm_block_ui()` modules, which are powered by the `scoutbaR` [package](https://cynkra.github.io/scoutbaR/). The latter provides a significantly better user experience with a powerful search bar with autocompletion and history management.

Then you can pass any extra plugin you developed as long as they belong to the one handled by `block.core`. The full list of available plugins can be found by running `board_plugins()`. You'll notice that `blockr.ui` does not yet use `edit_block` or `edit_block` plugins.
